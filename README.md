# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system.  
This repository contains my personal dotfiles, designed to work with Arch Linux.  
They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs.  
Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.

## Neovim

The neovim configuration folder works on top of NvChad: https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad
